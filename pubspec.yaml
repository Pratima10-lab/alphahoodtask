  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/Avatar.png
    - assets/images/Vector.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: Quicksand
    fonts:
       - asset: assets/fonts/static/Quicksand-Regular.ttf
  - family: Quicksand-bold   
    fonts:  
       - asset: assets/fonts/static/Quicksand-Bold.ttf
         
       
 
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
